# Stick2It
*a lifestyle app to help improve organization and productivity*


A final project for our third year software engineering class.  We were tasked with creating a useful product within our groups.  Stick2it was conceived as a simple, yet pratical project.

### Tech Stack and Methodology
Working in a group, Python seemed like an ideal languageas as it is known for being easy to pick to and extremly versitile.  Using PyQt to build our GUI was new for all members and a hurdle, but in the end was the best choice for quickly creating a useable user interface.

### Walkthrough
Stick2It is a modular desktop application that bundles a handful of useful productivity widgets into one conveient package.  Included is: a (non-volitile) To Do List, Calender (which counts how many days are left in between a specified date and the current date), a Budgeter, and a timer.


### Takeaway
Working in an iterative style along side group members was a new technique for all of us to learn.  In heinse sight we did a pretty good job at manageing and distributing work, keeping agile, and working collabortivly over GitHub.  The size and scope of the project is small and simple, but that was the plan to allow ourselves room to learn and adapt to this new methodlogy of building software as a team.
